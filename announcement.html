        <p>As we continue to navigate through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our community and our members remain our top priority. We must all do our part to prevent the spread of the virus and protect ourselves and others. Here are some important guidelines and measures that we must adhere to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mask Requirement:</strong> Masks will be required for all indoor rehearsals, meetings, and performances, regardless of vaccination status. Masks should fully cover the nose and mouth and be worn at all times when indoors, except when actively playing a wind instrument.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Distancing:</strong> Whenever possible, we will maintain a safe distance of at least six feet between members during rehearsals and performances. This includes spacing out while marching and avoiding congregating in large groups before and after events.</li>
            <li><strong>Hand Hygiene:</strong> Proper hand hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of the virus. We encourage all members to regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Home if Sick:</strong> If you are experiencing any symptoms of illness, including fever, cough, sore throat, or loss of taste or smell, please stay home and refrain from attending rehearsals or performances until you are fully recovered.</li>
            <li><strong>Vaccination and Testing:</strong> We strongly encourage all eligible members to receive the COVID-19 vaccine to protect themselves and others. Additionally, we may implement periodic testing for members, especially before important events or travel.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect Venue Policies:</strong> When performing at external venues, we will adhere to any additional COVID-19 guidelines and protocols implemented by the organizers or hosts. This may include wearing masks, providing proof of vaccination or negative test results, or adhering to capacity limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility and Adaptability:</strong> As the situation evolves, we must remain flexible and adapt our plans and procedures accordingly. We will continue to monitor guidance from health authorities and adjust our practices as needed to ensure the safety of our members and community.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By following these guidelines and working together, we can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and continue to enjoy the experience of making music together as a community marching band. Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to keeping each other safe.</p>
