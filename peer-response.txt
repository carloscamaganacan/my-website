Hi Carlos! Your website looks amazing. I love the picture background on the home page and the video/image scroll on the Video Gallery and Photo Gallery pages.
I also like the silhouette behind the text on the Newsletter page. I have no trouble reading the black text but if you are worried I don't think it would hurt to go a bit lighter using RGBA. Your aside with past performances looks great and all of your content is clear, relevant, and helpful. There are only a few things I think can be improved here. I visited your website on mobile first, and I hadn't known that the background image on the homepage was a person.
I think it still looks ok, but if you wanted to center the text box I think it could look better. It looks only slightly off center, so it's feels a bit weird. Then maybe either shift the background image or exchange it for one better suited for mobile? Up to you. Also on mobile, the scroll arrows for the video and photo gallery extend past the viewport width, so I have a horizontal scrollbar.
I think it would be better if you could fit both arrows and the video/photo into the shorter width or change it to a vertical scroll with a media query where the arrows are above and below the video/image. Then, on the newsletter page, I noticed that the text box background wasn't centered and only one side extended to the edge of the viewport. This caused a horizontal scroll to appear. I don't think that was your intention.
Lastly, because the header gets longer, your content is no longer above the fold. Maybe shrink the font size a bit so you can see at least the menu and welcome part?
Otherwise, your website is really good. I think you do a great job at keeping stuff above the fold and I like the menu on mobile.

Hi Carlos! I just want to start off by pointing out the appearance of your website. It has a strong sense of unity and flows together nicely, and I noticed you based it off of the logo in the top left corner which is very clever! Second, your website is laid out very well altogether and easy to navigate thanks to your lovely navigation menu with lots of informative resources. If I were to pick something you could improve on, I would recommend revising your home page to include more information above the fold line. On my screen, I only see the "Welcome" box underneath the navigation menu. I think that you could make the "Welcome" and "Our mission" boxes horizontal, maybe turn them into columns. I see that you're hovering them to the left to show off the picture on the right, but maybe you can do a similar silhouette design as you did on the newsletter subpage.  Secondly, on your newsletter page, I would also recommend that you put the "Upcoming Performance Schedule" at the top. Lastly, this is optional, but I think it would be fun if you could include another tab in the navigation menu that shows off all of the bands' achievements, as I know there's a good amount of them! Overall, wonderful website, great job!
