1.Feedback from Ollie Schmick:

Hi Carlos! Your website looks amazing. I love the picture background on the home page and the video/image scroll on the Video Gallery and Photo Gallery pages.
I also like the silhouette behind the text on the Newsletter page. I have no trouble reading the black text but if you are worried I don't think it would hurt to go a bit lighter using RGBA. Your aside with past performances looks great and all of your content is clear, relevant, and helpful. There are only a few things I think can be improved here. I visited your website on mobile first, and I hadn't known that the background image on the homepage was a person.
I think it still looks ok, but if you wanted to center the text box I think it could look better. It looks only slightly off center, so it's feels a bit weird. Then maybe either shift the background image or exchange it for one better suited for mobile? Up to you. Also, on mobile, the scroll arrows for the video and photo gallery extend past the viewport width, so I have a horizontal scrollbar.
I think it would be better if you could fit both arrows and the video/photo into the shorter width or change it to a vertical scroll with a media query where the arrows are above and below the video/image. Then, on the newsletter page, I noticed that the text box background wasn't centered and only one side extended to the edge of the viewport. This caused a horizontal scroll to appear. I don't think that was your intention.
Lastly, because the header gets longer, your content is no longer above the fold. Maybe shrink the font size a bit so you can see at least the menu and welcome part?
Otherwise, your website is really good. I think you do a great job at keeping stuff above the fold and I like the menu on mobile.

2.Feedback from Hailey Brown:

Hi Carlos! I just want to start off by pointing out the appearance of your website. It has a strong sense of unity and flows together nicely, and I noticed you based it off of the logo in the top left corner which is very clever! Second, your website is laid out very well altogether and easy to navigate thanks to your lovely navigation menu with lots of informative resources. If I were to pick something you could improve on, I would recommend revising your home page to include more information above the fold line. On my screen, I only see the "Welcome" box underneath the navigation menu. I think that you could make the "Welcome" and "Our mission" boxes horizontal, maybe turn them into columns. I see that you're hovering them to the left to show off the picture on the right, but maybe you can do a similar silhouette design as you did on the newsletter subpage.  Secondly, on your newsletter page, I would also recommend that you put the "Upcoming Performance Schedule" at the top. Lastly, this is optional, but I think it would be fun if you could include another tab in the navigation menu that shows off all of the bands' achievements, as I know there's a good amount of them! Overall, wonderful website, great job!

3.Changes/Improvement based on Feedback:

•	The background image in the Newsletter page was replaced with a new image without silhouettes or dark images to improve text readability and contrast. (Response to Ollie Schmick)
•	Correction made to align the text box in the Newsletter page by removing the unnecessary right and left margin. This fixes the off-center issue with the text box which is also not align with the header box.  (Response to Ollie Schmick)
•	The photo and video carousels are from commoninja.com and was design to view in landscape mode especially the videos.  I tried to reduce the screen size to be able to see the hidden arrows on the leftmost and rightmost part of the screen but it won’t let me.  The only solution is to remove the arrows and instead use an auto transitions like every 5 seconds or select the small dots below the viewer. I made the changes to remove the arrows to let you know which is better.  For the photo carousel you can use your finger or stylus pen to change the photos. The arrows are still there but will only show in landscape mode or in bigger screen.  (Response to Ollie Schmick)
•	The alignment of the text box was corrected, removing the extra margin.  The horizontal scroll bar is not anymore appearing on the screen.  (Response to Ollie Schmick)
•	Top and bottom margin in the header section were removed, logo re-oriented above the text and also the size of the logo and text were reduced to place content of the body above the fold. (Response to Ollie Schmick)
•	Same as Ollie Schmick’s feedback above to make more space above the fold, adjusted were made to remove the top & bottom margins in the header section and adjust the size of the logo and header text. (Response to Hailey Brown)
•	In the Newsletter page, the “Upcoming Performance Schedule (table) were move up as the first topic. (Response to Hailey Brown) 
•	It will be more work and will run out of time if I add another page or tab for the band’s achievement and since I have created 7 webpages that is more than the minimum required of 4 pages.  I’m only concern of the requirements for this project and I think I complied.  Also, the band’s achievement information although not in detail is already shown in the About Us page under the “Accomplishment” widgets.  (Response to Hailey Brown)
